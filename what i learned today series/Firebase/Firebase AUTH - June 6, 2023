1) Authentication basics

1. create vite app, install firebase, create firebase-config file

2. create project and register project, generate sdk and copy to firebase-config

3. once app and firebase are connected, click authentication from firebase project console

4. choose a sign-in method, for this we are using email/password, enable it

5. in firebase config, initialize auth

- import {getAuth} from 'firebase/auth'
- export const auth = getAuth(app) --- need to be exported cause we will call in other places in our app

6. import auth into file that will use it

7. Create User

// will create a new user and log the new user in
const user = await createUserWithEmailAndPassword(auth, regEmail, regPassword);

8. Login User

9. Sign out


10. to listen to auth changes use onAuthStateChanged and useEffect


  useEffect(() => {
    const listen = onAuthStateChanged(auth, (user) => {
      if (user) {
        console.log(user);
        setAuthUser(user);
      } else {
        setAuthUser(null);
      }

      return () => listen();
    });
  }, []);



========================

PROTECTED ROUTES with firebase auth


-continue with current react app

1. install react router and tailwind

2. setup routes for signin signup and user profile

3. setup firebase and firebase auth

4. create context to save user logged in. - able to use auth user for whole app with context

5. use authUser in global state to protect routes
- check if authuser is not null, if null navigate to login, use Navigate component of react router

- can also create a ProtectedRoute component
