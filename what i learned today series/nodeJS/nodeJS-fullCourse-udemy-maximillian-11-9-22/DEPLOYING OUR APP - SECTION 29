**last 3 often handled by hosting provider





1. using environment variables
-npm i dotenv
-and import in server like this => require("dotenv").config();

--for some reason, max did not use dotenv, instead he used nodemon.json and added env variables there. to be used for development.


2. Setting Secure Response Headers w Helmet

app.use(helmet())


3. Compressing assets
-npm i compression

app.use(compression());


4. Setting up Request Logging
with the use of MORGAN

-npm i morgan

app.use(morgan("combined"));

---to write logs in file system instead of console

const accessLogStream = fs.createWriteStream(path.join(__dirname, "access.log"), { flags: "a" }); // flags append
app.use(morgan("combined", { stream: accessLogStream }));


5. SSL / TLS
