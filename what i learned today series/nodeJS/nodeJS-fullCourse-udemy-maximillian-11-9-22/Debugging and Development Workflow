Debugging and Development Workflow



==Understanding NPM Scripts==

NPM - Node Package Manager


npm init - initialize project with package.json (config file)

====> scripts
"start" - reserved script command => npm start
"start-server" - you can name anything => npm run start-server



==Installing 3rd Party Packages==


usual node project:

Local Project
<Your Code>
Core Node Packages
Dependencies (3rd Party) ex - Express, dotenv, cors (from npm Repository)


npm install - go through your package.json and install dependencies and devdependencies there
=> will create the node_modules folders



example - install nodemon in your devdependencies

=> npm i nodemon -D

--- packages are installed in the node_modules.




==Understanding Differenet Error Types==

Types of Errors
1. Syntax Errors - typos or commands unknown to node or javascript

2. Runtime Errors - errors from code that break when you run them

3. Logical Errors - when your app doesnt work the way it should, no warnings shown.


==Finding and Fixing Syntax Errors==
==Dealing with Runtime Errors==

==Logical Errors==
-your app continues to work but not the way you expect it to.

--one tool to help with solving the problem is with the use of the debugger, which is integrated in vscode.
