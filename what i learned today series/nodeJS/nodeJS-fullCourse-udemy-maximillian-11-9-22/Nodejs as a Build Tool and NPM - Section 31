Understanding NPM - Node Package Manager

npm CLI

-other users can use packages stored in npm repository - npm install



NODEJS

1) spin up a web server
2) run any JS file
3) read and write files


Build Tool
-meaning like in react, you are not using node directly but under the hood
-optimize unoptimized code

-example is in a react app, when you run npm run build, it produces a minified version of your react code.
-that is readable even in old browsers. etc


Using Node in Build Processes
-like webpack, utility scripts etc
