DYNAMIC ROUTES and ADVANCED MODELS - SECTION 9


1. add an id to your created Product. i used uuid. same implementation as i did with MAX

2. create route and pass dynamic id. /product-detail/id

colon and variable => :id or :productId --- for it to be dynamic

ejs => <a href="/product-detail/<%= product.id %>" class="btn">View</a> --- link that calls dynamic product route, passes product id
routes => router.get("/product-detail/:id", getProductDetail);


-- to access dynamic route, in middleware, access through req.params.id ---id property is what you set with the colon.
-- it can be whatever you name it after the colon.


STATIC class methods => means that method can be called from class without instantiating the class

--- all your methods in Product class are database methods that are built in , for example, mongodb.
--- but since you are not using a database yet, we are doing the functions manually. like saving, findbyid, fetching all etc.




req.params => url/1345 => 1234
req.query => url?edit=true => edit: "true"



---- did tasks on my own, add to cart, delete item, edit item. but all got too complex and had to just copy max's code in the end.
---- good practice tho using JS and object oriented class usage

---- these basically are abstracted in mongoose. but yes basic MVC pattern nonetheless.
