FIRST TASTE OF PRISMA!!

 
==initial project setup
1. create nextjs ts latest app 

2. install prisma - npx prisma

3. npx prisma init
---this will create prisma dir with schema.prisma file and also will create a .env file

4. create database from supabase, add db connection string in env

5. create schemas in schema.prisma file much like models in mongodb?


==== now on to the backend setup

6. everytime you make updates to your schema.prisma file, you need to run => npx prisma migrate dev
--this will ask you for a migration name
--this command created a migration file -- sql commands automatically written

7. next run command => npx prisma studio
---see your models in your browser window. like a browser gui

=== frontend setup

8. npm install @prisma/client    and   npx prisma generate


takeway --- very very similar to how you would use mongoose.
