==React native Refresher


Components are compiled to native views

--- react native maps reusable components to respective platform equivalents
--- converts <View> into android.View and UIView (for android and IOS)


Javascript logic is not compiled, instead react runs a javascript thread (runtime)



Custom components => combination of react native core components

const MyButton = ({title}) => {
  return (
       <View>
        <Button title={title} />
       </View>
  )
}


Views uses flexbox by default. also by default direction is column.


Sometimes, a feature will work on android but not on ios and vice versa.
-ex. border radius on a Text element will work on android but not on ios.
-solution: wrap the Text in a more generic element (View) and apply border radius there.


===FLATLIST=== 
option 1- if your list item has a "key" property, flatlist will automatically use this as keys for the list
option 2- key extractor should be used if your list item does not have "key", for example, "id"


==PRESSABLE==

can return a callback that takes in {pressed} for ripple effect in ios. android has built in ripple

 <Pressable
        android_ripple={{ color: "#210644" }}
        style={(item) => item.pressed && styles.pressedItem}
        onPress={() => handleDelete(item)}
     >


     
==MODAL==

<Modal visible={modalVisible} animationType="slide"></Modal>
