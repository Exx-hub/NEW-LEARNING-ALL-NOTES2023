week 6 python - section and short

topics:

string
dot notation (methods)
loops
dictionaries
libraries
file reading and writing





== Strings

text = input("What is your name? ")

-comparing strings

if text == "alvin":
    print("Same.")
    
text[0] // "a"



== Dot Notation 

-we can use string methods using dot notation

text.strip() - remove whitespaces
text.lower() - converts all chars into lowercase
text.catpitalize() - convert first char into uppercase


text.split() - split a string into items delimited

== LOOPS

for/in - iterate through something called an "iterable"

iterables:
-string
-list
-tuple
-dicts
-range
-sets



for c in text:
    print(c)
    
    - loop through each char of the text

for word in words:
    print(word)
    
    - can be used for lists too
    
    
for _ in words:
    print("Goodnight Moon")
    
--looping through word list but not using variable we use underscore    
== Slicing a list
word[2:] - item at 2nd index and up to end of list
word[2:4] - item at 2nd index and item before 4th index

*1st argument is inclusive 2nd argument is exclusive



== DICTIONARIES

- key value pairs
- for lookup
- similar to javascript object

book = dict() or book = {}

book["title"] = "Corduroy"
book["author"] = "JK Rowling"

print(book["title"]) // Corduroy

or

book = {
    "title": "Goodnight moon",
    "author": "Margaret Wise Brown"
}

-- can also be list of dictionaries


== TUPLES

("George Washington", 1789)
(1,2,3,4,5)

-tuples are iterable

my_list = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]

# Iterate over the list of tuples and unpack them
for a, b in my_list:
    print(a, b) 




== METHOD CHAINING -- just like in javascript

book["title"] = input("Title: ").strip().capitalize()



== LIBRARIES AND MODULES

csv module -

-csv -> comma separated values

import csv

from csv import DictReader



== File READING and WRITING

import csv

books = []

# add books to your shelf by reading from books.csv

# open while indented, and close when indentation ends
with open("books.csv") as file:
    file_reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    for book in file_reader:
        books.append(book)

for book in books:
    print(book["Title"])
