DATA TYPES:

INT - integer

4 bytes of memory (32 bits)

-2 to 31st power up to 2 to the 31st power minus 1 for 0.

4 billion or negative 2billion and 2 billion



unsigned int. (qualifier) - if you know your value will never be int.

0 to 4 billion.



CHAR - character

1 byte (8 bits)


FLOAT - floating point 

4 bytes (32 bits)


DOUBLE - double precision of float. to be more precise with decimal values

8 bytes (64 bits)



VOID - not a data type but a type.



BOOL - boolean


STRING - series of characters



int c = 20



LOOPS 

while loop
- can be infinite loop if just passed with true

while (true)
{
// do this
}

- can be conditional depending on the condition passed. 

while (x < 4)
{
// do this
}



do
{
// do this at least once...and again until condition is false
}
while (x < 4)


for (int i = 0; i < 4: i++)
{
// do this. then increase i. if i equates to 4, dont do this anymore.
// so code here will be done 3 times. 
}
