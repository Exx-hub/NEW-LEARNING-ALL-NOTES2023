HTTP BASICS/ KNOW-HOW:

feb 22:

TCP/IP - transmission control protocol / internet protocol

--internet protocol suite. the internet runs on this protocol
--transfers information between client and server


when you type a url and press enter,
that address is converted into an ip address => dns lookup


DOMAIN NAME SYTEM - 
dns resolver, asks dns server what ip address a certain domain name converts to
if first time, might ask other dns if they know ip address.
but after first time, the ip address is cached for next time.

www.alvinacosta.com => domain name
76.76.21.21 => ip address

browser contacts DNS server => to get ip address of domain name

browser then uses ip address to make a request to the server

gets back a response from server contacted if you will.


HTTP Status Codes:
way of server informing you about result of response.

200 - successful responses
300 - redirect or moved
404 - not found / client messed up
500 - server problem / server messed up


PORT NUMBER:

-by default http => port number 80
-by default https => port 443

ports are used to run multiple services on a single machine.
localhost => usually 3000
mongodb => usually 27017
and so on.


REQUEST METHOD:

-once we have connected to the port and ip address by resolving the domain name into the ip address,

-so when a connection is established,
-next thing client does is sends request method


GET POST PUT PATCH DELETE OPTIONS

---get and post most important. for getting resources and sending data.

so why do you need the others?

1. for semantic purposes. like a delete request, duh, for deleting something. and so on.

2. for multiple requests to same endpoint. 
ex. post request to https://acosta.codes/api/users, also a put request to the same endpoint
