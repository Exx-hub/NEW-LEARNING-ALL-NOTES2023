Day 1 | Using percentages & avoiding heights

PERCENTAGES

--by default, html only is responsive, may not look good but responsive.
-- by adding set values like width:800px for examples, this creates issues like side scrolling if screen becomes smaller

why is it responsive by default:
-block level elements like divs , headings, paragraphs => they are of width: 100%. this makes it responsive by default
-a hundred percent of what? => the parent element


	
--- avoid set values, instead use percentages.

-- even in child elements. use percentage, for the child to just take space within the parent no matter how big or small the parent is



AVOIDING HEIGHTS

-avoid using heights as much as possible. this removes the natural responsiveness because when the screen size adjusts, the set values for something will still be followed. 

- for more space in a hero component for example, instead of using height, add padding

- use em or rem for responsiveness, try to avoid px or set units
