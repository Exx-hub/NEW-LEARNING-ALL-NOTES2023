Media Queries Approach


media queries => add complexity as screen gets bigger

ex. big screen => font-sze big
then medium screen => re-set font size to small

--- it should be => medium screen - font size default
then big screen add media query => font size big

easier to do mobile first. 

mobile => most are unset. just natural positions and defaults, but overwriting set rules as screens go bigger is also okay
--- like little padding on mobile and add more padding on bigger screens

then when screens get bigger, add media queries to adjust defaults.


when going for big screens first,

so you set all your css rules, on medium screens add media query to re-set all css 
then when mobile the same thing..


99% of the time => use min-width for MQ
--- go mobile first

--- when starting out the site, set the global styling first, colors, themes, typography, background , and a bit of spacing
--- start with the default order of things first.
--- then as screen gets bigger, you add the complexity like columns and grids and flexboxes etc.


css clamp

==========

min-width => required width to apply rules, screen has to cross or reach this 600px threshold for the rules inside to take effect

max-width => maximum width of screen allowed for the rules to STAY in effect. once over the max width, rules inside no longer apply

--MOBILE FIRST--
@media (min-width: 600px){

}

--DESKTOP FIRST--
@media (max-width: 600px){

}

-- he did how i usually approached it from desktop first to smaller

--- maybe good idea to set range of max-width and min-width for less breakpoints

examples => 
*from zero to 480px --- mobile devices
@media screen and (max-width: 480px){
	// rules
}

*from 481 to 768px --- tablet devices
@media screen and (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 768px){
	// rules
}

*from 769 to 1200 --- laptop devices
@media screen and (min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1200px){
	// rules
}

*from 1201 and up --- desktop and large screen devices
@media screen and (min-width: 1201px) {
	// rules
}


-- or use break point variables (scss)
$desktop: 1200px
$laptop: 1024px
$tablet: 768px
$mobile: 480px

*for dekstops and larger
@media screen and (min-width: $desktop) {
	// rules
}

*for laptops
@media screen and (min-width: $laptop) {
	// rules
}

*for tablets
@media screen and (min-width: $tablet) {
	// rules
}

*for mobile
@media screen and (min-width: $mobile) {
	// rules
}
