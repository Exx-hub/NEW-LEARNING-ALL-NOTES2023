pages?


1. HOME => banner landing page shit and navigation , greeting nandito pede din plus overview ng personal data like how many tasks or projects currently meron. etc.


then a page for one feature.
each page/feature is independent naman. so no order ng development. and kahit paisa isa and dag dag.
importante maganda yung concept ng landing page.





Development:


1. bootstrap app - install dependencies 
-vite
-tailwind
-react router
-firebase
-react icons

2. setup firebase and firebase config


3. Setup Routing and Navigation

4. setting up main bg gradient, added roboto font and changed favicon and title


5. APP and HOME component --- setup routing

- setup createBrowserRouter with children, to be able to nest navbar and main contents.
- create Layout component and set as main element for "/" path. with your page routes as children
- also add Navbar component to Layout and use Outlet to display nested routes from layout

// Home page

---> NAVBAR
- logo and navlinks
-hide navlinks if in home page
-active page link styling

-- navlinks complete

---> greeting and time

---> WEATHER Component
-fetches weather data from api and displays icon based on weather and temperature 
-relocated weather to top right inside navbar

---> Feature Card
---> Icon Square 
-hover animation, navlinks

--done with home page including media queries



// CHAT BOT page

-converting javascript implementation to react.
-used streaming data to display answer word by word fashion not all at once.

-fixing and understanding streaming.. - FIXED
- now fixing abort controller does not cancel.. -- placed controller outside, as a global variable

- media queries done


// ERROR Page

- done



// rubber ducky page


- done


// GOALS PAGE

-dev goals and life goals -> nested route - NO, just state switching and conditional display

- fetch goals and filter based on type -> life or career
- add goals
- delete goals


// Sticky notes page

- grid layout 
- hover effect
- 120 character limit to the input
- media queries for the grid

- encountered bug when deleting, it moves the notes' index when one is deleted, causing notes to change color
- this was a problem with using index. so added new field to the document. "ordinal", so when one note is deleted, layout does not shift.

- fixed deleting by the solution above but another bug was caused by this. when you add a new note after deleting,
sometimes the ordinal will be the same with one of the remaining because i am not adding an ordinal field when adding a note based on todos.length.

-fixed bug by first saving into state the ordinals of the notes remaining once fetched,
-then find the missing numbers when compared to [0,1,2,3,4,5]
-when missing numbers are found, get the lowest of those.
-that will be the ordinal when you create a new one. then cycle repeats.

-created a helper function for this.


export const getMissingOrdinal = (arr: (number | undefined)[]) => {
  const ordinals = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

  const set1 = new Set(arr);

  const missingNumbers = ordinals.filter((num) => !set1.has(num));

  return Math.min(...missingNumbers);
};


-fixed issue, able to delete in place, and add in correct place



// mobile nav

- DONE!!




// Pomodoro


- DONE


// AUTH SETUP

- remove weather for now
- add person icon and sign in link?



// DEPLOYMENT

--whitelist domain for firebase auth
--import env variables in vercel
-- deploy, very easy



hooks used:

---> useGreeting Hook
-returns greeting
-returns evening afternoon and morning depending on the time, used for greeting.

---> useGetTime 
-returns time as string - used to display time
-also returns isAm --- used for moon or sun in icon


--> useTimer
--for watching time in pomodoro


---> useTitle



Learning:

1. Layout and nested routes in new createBrowserRouter using Outlet

2. favicon not showing up, added question mark and it works
   - <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/favicon.ico?" />
   
3. created switch case to conditionally display icon
--- was getting typescript error when i was trying to implement with object lookup
--- so created a function instead with a switch case

  const getIcon = (weather: string | undefined) => {
    switch (weather) {
      case "Clouds":
        return <FaCloud />;
      case "Rain":
        return morning ? <FaCloudShowersHeavy /> : <FaCloudMoonRain />;
      case "Clear":
        return morning ? <FaCloudSun /> : <FaCloudMoon />;
      default:
        return;
    }
  };
  
4. calc in tailwind -> h-[calc(100vh-58px)]  ->  100vh minus height of navbar 

5. animation using keyframes
--- extend in tailwind config


  keyframes: {
        "slide-down": {
          "0%": { transform: "translateY(-50px)", opacity: 0 },
          "100%": { transform: "translateY(0)", opacity: 1 },
        },
      },
      animation: {
        "slide-from-top": "slide-down 300ms both",
      },
      
      
6. used another switch case for icon square react icons. unable to pass as props, typescript is angry


7. USEMATCH of react router to get path, instead of using location.pathname in useLocation

8. env in vite , variable has to start with VITE, to use -> import.meta.env.VITEVARIABLE

9. type abort Controller -> let controller: AbortController | null = null;

10. add stream true to be able to get streamed response


11. Goals component, conditionally render career goals and life goals using state toggle with tabs
    --- career and life share state instead of state for each.
    
12. cannot do same animation on both components that are conditionally rendered?

13. Cool GRID LAYOUT

14. hover and unhover blur effect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


15. encountered error, layout shift when using index when deleting. also when adding after deleting
    - used some javascript to get ordinals of notes, get missing when compared to array of 6 numbers 0-6
    - from missing get lowest, this will be ordinal of note that will be created next.
    -fixed issue, able to delete in place, and add in correct place
    
    
16. USE opacity and CSS for transition animations, instead of react conditional render for easier transition animation. use opacity 0 and 1, add condition to classname, change classname based on state

17. Watching time with interval and useEffect
