REALIZATIONS / Questions:

1. is way of rendering pages correct? like in pages/cart.tsx , just render CartItemList and pass props from getServerSideProps.
  -- why not do the logic in this page mismo?
  
  
2. how to use redux toolkit with nextjs?


3. verify usage of mongoose like models etc.


4. updating getServerSideProps after fetch or update api?


5. use nextjs with swr or react query?
