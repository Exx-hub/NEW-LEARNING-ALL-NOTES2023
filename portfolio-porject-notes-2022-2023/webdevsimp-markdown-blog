8. connect to db mongoose , set up db connection

9. create models folder and an articleSchema - structure correct data on schema

10. start creating data and testing adding and reading data


11. install marked and slugify

12. add pre validate function to articleSchema, to create slug using the title as new article gets created

articleSchema.pre("validate", function (next) {
  if (this.title) {
    this.slug = slugify(this.title, { lower: true, strict: true });
  }

  next()
});


13. delete and edit buttons

a link <a> can only do get requests

and a form method and action, can only do get or post

so we need to instsall a library called method-override to be able to use delete or put in a form method

after installation in server.js

const methodOverride = require('method-override')
app.use(methodOverride('_method'))


in html:

	  <form action="/articles/delete/<%= article.id %>?_method=DELETE" method="POST">
            <button class="btn btn-danger">Delete</button>
          </form>
